# Niles - Discord Bot Framework

Niles is a chatbot framework designed for Discord. It was originally designed for an esport team Discord server and is now updated to become a simple tool to create custom Discord bots.
Because adding bot to your server need either choosing between : 
- Several all-in-one hosted bots that are very simple but can cost money to fully customize it, and impossible to self-host, so you can't add any feature to it
- Discord libraries that require to code all features from scratch
Niles aims to simplify the development of your Discord Bot with many tools to quickly deploy yours idea into your server.
